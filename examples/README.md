#   Computational Photonics Toolbox (`PhotonX.jl`)

</div>

This library was designed as an theoretical and numerical toolkit on light propagation estimation through optical media both in classical and quantum approach. It's mainly designed as an experimental toolbox for guided optics, but it also comprehends theoretical approach and nonlinear responses presented by materials.

##  Classical optics fundamentals

In context of classical optics, light is fundamentally described by electromagnetic theory. According to Faraday-Lenz and AmpÃ¨re laws, both electric and magnetic fields oscillating could sustain and regenerate each other, that's the essence of light's nature - light consists in a vectorial wave phenomena sustained by the oscillation of driving force fields which perturbation travels through space along the evolution of time.

### Wave properties of classical light

Usually, in experimental context, some of the characteristics of light are neglected, due to its minor relevance on the observed phenomena. The main aspect which is widely neglected is the vectorial aspect of light waves, however, since lasers is the main source of light in experiments, some other approximations are taking into account, such as monochromaticity of light and its propagation anisotropy, leading to a simpler and cleaner, but also robust, framework - in which light could be described univocally by its amplitude along space.

Furthermore, exploring the Slow-varying envelope approximation by Fresnel approximation of spherical waves, discussing the fundamentals of gaussian beams, including their propagation and characteristics.

>   This notebook will, firstly, introduce the basics of Fourier optics as a approach on fundamental algebraic properties of light propagation in free-space, thus extending it for inhomogeneous optical media through split-step beam propagation method. Furthermore, discussing wavely phenomena such as diffraction, image formations and filtering, and minor examples on phase and amplitude modulations by holography.

>   This notebook will introduce the basics of higher order families of optical modes, namely hermite-gaussian and laguerre-gaussian modes, it will also discuss its algebraic properties such as orthogonality and symmetries. It will also approach on non-diffracting beams such as Bessel and Airy mode families.

>   This notebook will extends the previous approach on numerical approximation of light propagation, firstly, discussing conservation laws and introducing boundary conditions to supress numerical errors. Later, more robust methods such as Finite-differences (FD) and Finite-elements (FEM) will be introduced as alternative approaches on estimate how light propagates through optical media. Lastly, the design and simulation of neural network aided methods, namely Physics-informed Neural-networks (PINNs) will be discussed.

>
>   This notebook will extends holographic methods commonly used at an optics lab. Firstly, multiplane light conversion (MPLC) method will be discussed, and subsequently Neural-network aided methods will be introduced, focusing mainly in optical waveguides design to implement optical operations or transformations through linear inhomogeneities of an optical media.
